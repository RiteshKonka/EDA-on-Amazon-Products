# EDA on Amazon Products
 
 The Internet has revolutionized the way we buy products. In the retail e-commerce world of online marketplace, where experiencing products are not feasible. Also, in today’s retail marketing world, there are so many new products are emerging every day. Therefore, customers need to rely largely on product reviews to make up their minds for better decision making on purchase. However, searching and comparing text reviews can be frustrating for users. Hence we need better numerical ratings system based on the reviews which will make customers purchase decision with ease.During their decision making process, consumers want to find useful reviews as quickly as possible using rating system. Therefore, models able to predict the user rating from the text review are critically important. Getting an overall sense of a textual review could in turn improve consumer experience. Also, it can help businesses to increase sales, and improve the product by understanding customer’s needs.

Preprocessing Text:
Since, text is the most unstructured form of all the available data, various types of noise are present in it and the data is not readily analyzable without any pre-processing. The entire process of cleaning and standardization of text, making it noise-free and ready for analysis is known as text preprocessing

Analysis :
By analysing the average review rating with prices,product name,number of reviews,etc by univariate,bivariateand multivariate analysis we can drive a conclusion on how the data flows in a given situation of comparison. We can also predict how the product will preform in the future.
The importance of EDA are:
1.Helps identify errors
2.Promotes better understanding of patterns within the data
3.Helps detect abnormal events.
4.Helps understand data set variables and the relationship among them.
